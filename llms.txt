# Neural Claude Code Plugin

> A self-improving agentic system that transforms Claude Code into a persistent, learning AI assistant with multi-AI orchestration.

## Overview

Neural Claude Code solves the problem of stateless AI sessions. Traditional Claude Code starts from zero every time - users must repeatedly explain project structure, conventions, and preferences. Neural Claude Code remembers everything.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- Traditional: Execute -> Forget -> Repeat forever
- Neural: Execute -> Learn -> Improve always

## Key Capabilities

### Persistent Memory System
Three-tier memory architecture:
- Hot Memory: Current context window
- Warm Memory: JSON files for facts, events, sessions (instant access)
- Cold Memory: Archives and historical patterns

Commands: `/remember`, `/recall`, `/forget`

### Self-Learning Expertise
YAML-based domain knowledge that persists across sessions. Claude loads expertise at session start and learns from every interaction. Located in `.claude/expertise/` directory.

### Neural Loops
Autonomous coding sessions with the unified `/loop` command:
- Interactive mode (human-in-the-loop)
- AFK mode (away-from-keyboard, fully autonomous)
- Single iteration mode
- Example: `/loop "Add authentication" --afk --max 30`

### Multi-AI Orchestration
Route tasks to the optimal AI based on benchmarked strengths:
- Claude Opus 4.5 (80.9% SWE-bench): Architecture, code review, accuracy-critical
- GPT-5.1-Codex-Max (77.9% SWE-bench): CLI, DevOps, long sessions
- Gemini 3 Pro (76.2% SWE-bench): Algorithms, competitive coding

Commands: `/pv` (parallel verification), `/pv-mesh` (mesh verification)

### Skills System
19 reusable capabilities including:
- Memory management
- Deep research and content creation
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Debugging (4-phase root cause analysis)
- Pattern detection
- Parallel verification

### Agents
7 specialized agents:
- code-reviewer: Read-only code quality analysis
- multi-ai: Orchestrate all three AIs for high-stakes decisions
- dispatcher: Smart task routing
- codex: Route to OpenAI Codex
- gemini: Route to Google Gemini
- cognitive-amplifier: Complex decision support
- optimizer: Self-improvement patterns

## Technical Details

- **Version**: 4.0.0
- **License**: MIT
- **Author**: Alfredo Bonilla (@brolag)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/brolag/neural-claude-code-plugin
- **Homepage**: https://brolag.github.io/neural-claude-code-plugin

## Design Principles

1. Files over databases - Everything is human-readable YAML/JSON
2. Hooks over patches - Extend via hooks, don't modify core
3. Progressive enhancement - Works without configuration
4. Explicit over implicit - Knowledge is visible and traceable
5. Anti-bloat philosophy - Consolidate and clean before adding

## Use Cases

- **Long-running projects**: Claude remembers your codebase conventions
- **Team consistency**: Share expertise files for consistent AI behavior
- **Autonomous coding**: Run multi-hour coding sessions unattended
- **Multi-AI workflows**: Use the best AI for each specific task
- **Knowledge accumulation**: Build up project-specific knowledge over time

## Optional

- [llms-full.txt](llms-full.txt): Complete documentation in single file
- [subagents.txt](subagents.txt): Agent discovery manifest
